## TODO

- Add custom domain: https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/azure/dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns
- Add authentication: https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-authorization?tabs=invitations
- Add API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/add-api?tabs=vanilla-javascript

## Problem Solving

The idea is to provide a list of problems that can be solved by programming, math, numerical analysis, etc.

Ideas for problems:
 - numerical analysis: solution to equation with function not easily solvable by hand.
 - math/programming: collatz conjecture. Starting with n={some number} and calculating the collatz sequence, what
   is the product of the count of even and odd numbers?
 - math/programming: closest pairs in a grid of points.
 - numerical analysis: integral with complicated function not easily solvable by hand.
